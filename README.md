## Contributing

 This guide has several goals:

    Start important events that you need to visit a location, talk to an NPC, or pick up an item (and then these can be completed from the Journal tab)
    Show story-related missable events (trivial events are excluded)
    Keep you from missing out by unintentionally breaking quests through resting, traveling ahead, or doing things out of order
    This guide generally assumes a neutral or good playthrough, so evil missables are possible

It also has several non-goals:

    Include full walkthroughs of quests
    Include quest events once they're in the Journal
    Link to Fextralife (always use bg3.wiki for links)

Feel free to submit a PR. All checklist items are sourced from the [checklist.md](https://github.com/plasticmacaroni/bg3-missables/blob/main/checklist.md) file. Here's what to know:
1. Heading sections start with "# Heading"
2. Bullets start with "- Bullet"
3. Sub-bullets include two spaces per sub-level
4. Links follow markdown formatting "[Link] (link-reference)"
5. No linking to FextraLife, use bg3.wiki
6. Try to make bullets as spoiler-free as possible
